; NAME:
;       SMOOTH2
; PURPOSE:
;       Do multiple smoothing. Gives near Gaussian smoothing.
; CATEGORY:
; CALLING SEQUENCE:
;       b = smooth2(a, w)
; INPUTS:
;       a = array to smooth (1,2, or 3-d).  in
;       w = smoothing window size.          in
; KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
; OUTPUTS:
;       b = smoothed array.                 out
